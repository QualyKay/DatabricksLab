# Qualyfi Databricks Assessment
## Delta Live Table Pipeline
### DLT, UC &amp; Query Federation

#### In this project my aim was to answer business questions in areas such as sales performance, purchase patterns and to perform some product analysis.

## Tasks
- Create a Star Schema: To decide how the logical structure is to be physically implemented in the target database management system
-  Build out a WireFrame using the star schema design by creating models in Power BI using dummy data
-   1. Create a foreign catalog to federate data from the database 2. Create a standard catalog to store silver and gold quality data
- Write a function that will query the foreign catalog and bring the tables as-is into the standard catalog
- Write a function or functions that will create the Dimensions and Fact tables from the silver data
- Create a Delta Live Table Workflow to run the DLT on a schedule
- Retro-fit the WireFrame onto the final star schema in Power BI
